      <p>Dear Jennifer,</p>
      <p>Happy 26th birthday!!!!</p>
      <p>Sometimes it is funny to think that we only really got to know each other 6ish months ago.</p>
      <p>I have been thankful for your willingness to be the butt of a joke,</p>
      <p> to get people to a place where they can joke,</p>
      <p>and loosen our MC up to form the friendships we have across the group.</p>
      <p>But most of all, I am thankful we have had each other in this season of #figuringthingsout</p>
      <p>and also learning to not try too hard to figure things out but to leave it to God.</p>
      <p>Let's continue praying and doing lyfe together and only crying sometimes~</p>
      <p>HBD!!!</p>

      <p>Happy 26th!! Does this mean you're done with your quarter life crisis now?</p>
      <p>Crisis or not, it has been so great getting to know you and being in the same community.</p>
      <p>Every group needs a goofy goober. To many more!</p>

      <p>I still think about how you made the hour-long trek over to BRAD in the middle of a blizzard,</p>
      <p>overcoming nature so that we could share updates and encourage each other through confusing times,</p>
      <p>and how you hit every single grocery store in Cambridge to gather me foods when I sprained my ankle.</p>
      <p>You‚Äôre so committed to making sure your friends feel loved and taken care of.</p>
      <p>You TRULY go the distance to bless people and I pray you have the most blessed day today.</p>
